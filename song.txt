First things first
I'm gonna say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh woo
The way that things have been, oh woo
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh.
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulk into the masses
